# TikTok Bot

## Configuration

To use this bot, follow these steps to configure your credentials:

1. Copy the file `credentials_example.py` and rename it to `credentials.py`.
2. Edit `credentials.py` with your personal credentials.
3. Obtain an API key to solve captchas from: [SadCaptcha](https://www.sadcaptcha.com/).

## Important Notes

- If you encounter a captcha-related error, you may have run out of credits. Check your balance here: [SadCaptcha API](https://www.sadcaptcha.com/api/v1/swagger-ui/index.html).
- The files `credentials.py` and `tiktok_cookies.json` are ignored by Git and will not be shared.  
- `tiktok_cookies.json` contain authentication data, so keep it secure.
